    just can't wait to get on the road again /
    The life I love is making music with my friends /
    And I can't wait to get on the road again /
    On the road again /
    Goin' places that I've never been /
    Seein' things that I may never see again /
    And I can't wait to get on the road again /
    On the road again /
    Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway /
    We're the best of friends /
    Insisting that the world keep turning our way /
    And our way /
    Is on the road again /
    I just can't wait to get on the road again /
    The life I love is makin' music with my friends /
    And I can't wait to get on the road again /
    On the road again /
